__Overview__ 

Welcome to the course website for the Summer Prep Bootcamp (SPB) offered by the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca) (DoSS) at the University of Toronto!  All information related to the bootcamp will be posted on this website.

The bootcamp will take place on Monday through Friday between July 11 and July 29 from 10 am to 3:30 pm.  The schedule may be found [here](schedule.html).
